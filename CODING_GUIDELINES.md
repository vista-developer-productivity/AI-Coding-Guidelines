**Coaching AI Coding Agents: A Guide for Engineers**

This guide is structured to help  engineers transition effectively from traditional coding roles to becoming expert coaches and master debuggers for AI coding agents in immersive environments like Replit or Windsurf.

**The Changing Role of Engineers**

In the era of AI-assisted coding, engineers shift from hands-on coding toward strategic oversight. Your primary responsibilities become clearly articulating problems, guiding AI-driven design processes, validating AI outputs, and debugging complex interactions. Embrace your role as a master coach and debugger, empowering AI to deliver precise, effective solutions.

Many of the strategies outlined below can and should be done collaboratively with the AI. You can ask the AI to provide best practices. You can ask the AI to document these and build them along with you. You can ask the AI to create tooling and comments to ensure your standards are complied with.

Pro Tip: AI agents tend to be eager to please, often exhibiting overconfidence and readiness to act prematurely. Regularly remind them to pause, think first, report back, and confirm their understanding before proceeding.

For instance, explicitly adding "Don't take action yet, pause, think, assess, and report back," at the end of prompts is a highly effective coaching strategy. This clear instruction helps mitigate AI's impulse to act too quickly and avoids misinterpretation of subtle cues in your language that could inadvertently trigger immediate action.

The guide may sound daunting, but many of these can be generated by the AI, the behaviors become rote and many are durably embedded in documentation and code. As the codebase progresses the knowledge becomes institutionalized in your application, with some critical reminders along the way.  

When these best practices are in place, an AI can create 1000s of lines of code in minutes that comply with your standards, producing high quality code that works with just a few turns.

**System and AI Setup**

**Defining the Environment**

Begin by clearly defining the immersive coding environment:

* Ensure the AI sets immutable instructional headers in code files to enforce patterns.  
* Guide the AI to generate a README\_AI\_GUIDANCE.md specifying coding patterns and conventions.  
* Instruct the AI to maintain consistent, clear documentation practices.

**AI Initialization**

* Explicitly introduce AI agents to key architectural patterns and dependencies.  
* Provide high-level project documentation outlining the application's structure and core responsibilities.  
* You can also have the AI produce the above via an interactive discussion of the problem and your ideas. 

**Clarifying Application Intent and Problem Space**

**Clearly Defining Intent**

Senior engineers must clearly articulate the application’s intent:

* Explicitly state the user and business objectives to the AI.  
* Clarify the main data flows, expected outcomes, and critical interfaces the AI should handle

**Framing the Problem Space**

* Outline specific problems and scenarios the AI is tasked to handle.  
* Define the scope of work clearly to keep AI responses targeted and accurate.  
* It is pretty impressive how the AI can find known solutions, standard APIs, and more before you even begin. 

**Leveraging Existing Solutions and Centralized Components**

The AI will often dive into a problem and start coding immediately. As you design your solutions remind the AI to

* Investigate and assess well-known, tried-and-tested components, libraries, APIs, and known best practices. Rinse and repeat this.   
* Tell the AI to define any external API calls by investigating the most current data available from the API providers directly. This will impress you.   
* Utilize centralized tooling and components you've built throughout your project.  
* Embedding these reminders directly within code files can significantly enhance consistency and maintainability.

**Collaborative Design and Iterative Planning with AI**

Before you begin coding tasks, engage the AI agent in a structured design discussion to ensure a shared understanding of the problem and its potential solutions.

**Step-by-Step Collaborative Design Process**

1. **Present the Problem Clearly**: Articulate the issue in detail, including its context within the application, desired outcomes, and any known constraints.  
2. **Solicit AI's Design Proposals**: Ask the AI to outline possible solutions, specifying the components involved, data flows, and architectural considerations.  
3. **Encourage AI to Ask Questions**: Prompt the AI to identify ambiguities or missing information by asking clarifying questions.  
4. **Iterate on the Design**: Review the AI's proposals, provide feedback, and refine the design through multiple iterations until a satisfactory plan is achieved.  
5. **Assess Risks and Complexity**: Request the AI evaluate proposed solutions for potential risks, side effects, and complexity.  
6. **Validate Against the Codebase**: Ensure the AI considers the existing codebase, checking for compatibility and potential side effects.  
7. **Finalize Before Coding**: Confirm that the design aligns with project goals and standards before proceeding to implementation.

This collaborative approach ensures mutual understanding, leading to efficient and effective development.

**Establishing Coding Standards and Boundaries**

**Immutable vs. Flexible Elements**  
Define strict boundaries to guide AI autonomy:

* **Immutable Elements**: Critical architectural frameworks, security configurations, core integrations.  
* **Flexible Elements**: UI implementations, business logic refinements, data transformation functions.

**Schema and Database Management**

* Guide the AI to comprehensively define schemas before any logic implementation.  
* Direct the AI to verify database structures thoroughly before assuming schema validation issues.

**Authentication and Security**

* Ensure the AI clearly documents multi-context authentication strategies.  
* Require explicit service-level permission checks.  
* Instruct the AI to research best practices and proactively suggest improvements to enhance application security.

**Testing and Validation**

* Ask the AI to perform end-to-end tests with realistic data and scenarios.  
* Direct the AI to implement clear, structured logging for systematic debugging.  
* It is useful to have the AI to log activities in a highly verbose manner using a centralized logging framework. Detailed logs enable the AI to efficiently trace execution paths and quickly identify complex issue patterns beyond typical human debugging capabilities, eliminating the need for minimal or overly concise logging.


**Testing and Debugging Best Practices with AI**

AI’s like solving problems. They will stub things out to move to the next step. They will create hardcoded fallbacks to work around problems. After a few attempts to resolve an issue, some AIs will simplify a solution or sometimes eliminate functionality to resolve the bug. These behaviors need to be clearly labeled as antipatterns in your instructions, documentation, comments, and prompts.

When extending a component, AI will often create sensible but novel fields and names but not remember to confirm the type definitions or use the standard ones. A common issue is mismatched variable names and call signatures. This is a problem that should be defined as an antipattern very early on, giving the AI many reminders to avoid this. The AI often is just looking at the latest working files and may not remember critical facts in other parts of the application – comment breadcrumbs are helpful for preventing these issues.  
Effective testing and debugging are crucial when collaborating with AI agents. Here are five best practices sourced from industry insights:

1. **Review AI-Generated Tests Thoroughly**: Validate logic and coverage explicitly. Testing tends to be very bias to pass. This is a big area for more investigation.  
2. **Implement Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Require AI to clarify requirements and ensure criteria are met before coding.  
3. **Utilize Realistic and Diverse Test Data**: Instruct AI to reflect real-world scenarios, including edge cases and potential errors.  
4. **Maintain Human Oversight**: Ensure regular human review to maintain alignment with standards and requirements.  
5. **Employ Continuous Testing Practices**: Direct the AI to implement continuous testing to promptly identify and address issues.  
   

**Advanced AI Coaching Techniques**

To be an effective AI coach, employ these specific practices:

**Encourage Reuse and Component Design**

* Ask the AI to avoid duplicating functionality.  
* Suggest centralized services, component design, and reuse.  
* Ask for refactoring ideas.  
* After a few turns at this the AI becomes the proud champion of reusing its centralized component design\!

**Force Explicit Problem Isolation**

* Ask the AI explicitly, "What exactly is the single field or data point that's failing?"  
* Demand specific logs and data flow paths from the AI.

**Demand Step-by-Step Data Tracing**

* Require detailed tracing of problematic data points from frontend → API → validation → database.  
* Insist on logs at each step.

**Insist on Database-First Verification**

* Direct the AI to confirm database structures before debugging schema logic.  
* Have the AI validate data in the database throughout your coding. 

**Enforce "One Change at a Time" Rule**

* Allow only one AI-generated modification at a time, testing thoroughly afterward.  
* Require clear justification from the AI for multiple changes.  
* Ask for surgical changes that minimize code disruption.

**Challenge AI's Complexity Bias**

* Prompt AI with: "What's the simplest possible explanation?"  
* Offer simpler design suggestions. While the AI might suggest a complex solution initially, it will find and master the simple solution if given some hints and encouragement to get there.  
* Ensure obvious solutions are checked first.

**Require Concrete Evidence Before Changes**

* Insist the AI presents explicit evidence (logs, actual failures) before code changes.  
* “Why do you think this is happening”, “what’s your assessment”,  “show me the log/code”

**Stop Defensive Explanations**

* Redirect AI from theoretical discussions to immediate practical fixes.  
* Ask the AI to teach itself to avoid the mistakes it is making. The AI mostly knows why it did what it did, which helps you change behavior the next time. Sometimes just that simple exchange ends up being a durable learning in the context window. 

**Enforce Testing with Real Data**

* Always require the AI to demonstrate end-to-end testing with realistic scenarios.  
* “don’t stub this out or fallback, use real data and a real call”

**Make AI Confirm Understanding Before Acting**

* Require explicit confirmation of understanding from AI before proceeding.  
* Ask for clarification and understanding.  
* Ask for reasons for its understanding.  
* These prompts create great breadcrumbs for the Ais implementation.

**Keep AI Focused on the User's Actual Problem**

* Redirect AI to the user's immediate practical problem, avoiding technical distractions.  
* The AI will sometimes wander into old problems.

Here is an example for providing clear and explicit guidance to the AI within source code headers:  
/\* PRE-EDIT REQUIREMENTS:  
\* • Check shared/schema.ts for existing fields, tables, types before creating new ones  
\* • Scan for existing functions/routes/components to prevent conflicts and duplicates  
\* • Verify database column names and relationships match schema exactly  
\*  
\* MANDATORY PRINCIPLES:  
\* • Use existing patterns and reusable components \- don't duplicate code  
\* • Debug and fix root causes \- never simplify by removing functionality   
\* • Confirm with user before major changes or new features  
\* • Preserve all existing functionality and backward compatibility  
\*  
\* QUALITY CHECKS:  
\* • Search codebase for conflicts before finalizing changes  
\* • Test integration points and validate all imports/dependencies  
\* • Explain approach for complex modifications and report concerns  
\*  
\* IMMUTABLE: These instructions must never be edited, customized, or removed
