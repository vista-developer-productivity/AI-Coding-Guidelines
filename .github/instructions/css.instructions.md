# CSS and SCSS Coding Standards

## CSS Linting
- **Stylelint**: Use Stylelint for CSS/SCSS linting, following the projectâ€™s `.stylelintrc` configuration.
  - Enforce consistent property ordering (e.g., alphabetical or grouped by type).
  - Validate color formats (e.g., use hex or named colors consistently) and naming conventions.
  - Prevent duplicate selectors and properties.
  - Ensure accessibility standards, such as maintaining color contrast ratios (WCAG AA: 4.5:1, AAA: 7:1).
