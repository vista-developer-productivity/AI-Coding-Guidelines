* How to use the CODING_GUIDELINES.md 

Coding with AI assisted tools can not be blindly done without the proper guidance.  In this directory, we have included a filed called CODING_GUIDANCE.md that provides the general advice on how to instruct your IDE agent to behave in the right ways.   LLMs are often very optimistic, and as an Engineer it is your responsibility to guide and coach the AI agents that align with our own internal guidelines, but also best practices for general software engineering. 

I encourage all of the teams to share their templates in this directory for greater knowledge sharing and a more community driven approach to ensuring our AI assisted tools work in the most effective way possible for us.  When using VSCode, follow the following guidance on how to add more specific instructions to your IDE - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#:~:text=In%20the%20Chat%20view%2C%20select,to%20specific%20files%20or%20folders.
